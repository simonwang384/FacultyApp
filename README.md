# FacultyApp

An IOS App that I made in my Mobile Computing class. The app is a app that holds information about professors attending NSU. The app reads the data from a JSON file and fills in a table based on the information. I used segues to send information to other ViewControllers, I used a navigation controller to handle multiple connected ViewControllers, and we had a Tab Bar to handle different tabs. One tab was for faculty and another was for courses being provided.
